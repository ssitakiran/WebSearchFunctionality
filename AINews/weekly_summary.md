#Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of AI-related news articles in markdown format, sorted by date from latest to earliest. Each entry needs the date in IST, a concise summary, and the source URL. 

First, I need to parse the provided content. There are multiple articles with dates, summaries, and URLs. I'll start by extracting each article's details. Let me check the dates first. The dates are in GMT, but I need to convert them to IST, which is GMT+5:30. Wait, the user specified IST, so I have to adjust each date accordingly.

Looking at the first article: Date is Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:24:49 GMT. Converting to IST would be adding 5 hours and 30 minutes. So 10:24:49 GMT becomes 15:54:49 on the same day. But the date remains December 25, 2025 in IST. Wait, actually, since IST is ahead, adding 5h30m might push it to the next day if the time crosses midnight. Let me check each date carefully.

Next, the summary needs to be concise. The user provided the first sentence or two of each article. I'll need to rephrase those into a single concise sentence capturing the main point. For example, the first article is about Amazon, Microsoft, and Google investing $67.5B in India for AI infrastructure.

Then, sorting the articles by date. The latest date is December 31, 2025. Wait, let me list all dates:

- 25 Dec 2025 (IST 25 Dec)
- 30 Dec 2025 (IST 30 Dec)
- 27 Dec 2025 (IST 27 Dec)
- 29 Dec 2025 (IST 29 Dec)
- 24 Dec 2025 (IST 24 Dec)
- 29 Dec 2025 (IST 29 Dec)
- 30 Dec 2025 (IST 30 Dec)
- 27 Dec 2025 (IST 27 Dec)
- 31 Dec 2025 (IST 31 Dec)

Wait, the last article is from Wed, 31 Dec 2025. That's the latest. So sorting from latest to earliest would start with the 31st, then the 30th articles, etc.

I need to make sure each date is converted correctly. Let's take each entry one by one. For example, "Date:Wed, 31 Dec 2025 05:27:00 GMT" becomes IST 31 Dec 2025 10:57:00. Since the summary is in IST, the date remains 2025-12-31.

Now, compiling the entries. Each entry should be in the format:

### [Date]
- [Summary](URL)

I'll need to arrange them starting from the latest date first. Let me check each date again to ensure correct order.

Also, the user mentioned to use the source URL as a link. Make sure each URL is correctly linked next to the summary.

I should verify that each summary is a concise sentence. For example, the article about the four Indian-origin entrepreneurs on Forbes' list can be summarized as highlighting their success in AI and fintech.

Lastly, ensure that the markdown format is correct, with headers for each date and bullet points for summaries.
