#Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the AI news articles summarized in markdown format with specific details. First, I need to parse through each of the provided articles and extract the necessary information: date in IST, a concise summary, and the source URL. 

Starting with the first article about Reliance's AI manifesto. The date is given in GMT, so I need to convert it to IST, which is typically 5.5 hours ahead. The original date is December 30, 2025, 18:20 GMT. Adding 5.5 hours makes it December 31, 2025, 13:55 IST. Wait, but the user might just need the date in IST format, not the exact time. So the date becomes 2025-12-31. The summary should highlight the 10x productivity boost and the impact on India.

Next, the article about AI legal rights. The date is December 31, 2025, 05:42 GMT. IST is 5.5 hours ahead, so that's December 31, 2025, 11:12 IST. The summary needs to mention the debate over granting AI legal rights and the implications for India's policies.

Then there's the article about stock market and AI. The date here is December 31, 2025, 07:06 GMT. Converting to IST would be 12:41 IST same day. However, the content here is a mix of stock alerts and other financial news, but the user might not want this as it's not directly about AI. Wait, the user said "Articles" but this one seems to be a mix of stock alerts and other headlines. The URL is from MarketBeat, but the content isn't a coherent article. Maybe this should be excluded since it's not a proper news piece. Let me check the user's instruction again. They provided all the content, so maybe include it if it mentions AI. Wait, the content has a mention of NVIDIA's $20B Groq deal and AI stocks. So the summary should note the NVIDIA deal as a warning shot to rivals.

The Zerodha cofounder article is December 31, 2025, 05:27 GMT. IST date is same, 11:02 IST. Summary about Indian-origin billionaires in AI, fintech, etc.

The TNW article recaps 2025's AI developments. Date is December 31, 2025, 10:28 GMT. IST time is 15:58. Summary about generative AI shifts, EU AI Act, and other trends.

Axios article on AI scientific breakthroughs: December 31, 2025, 10:00 GMT. IST is 15:30. Summary mentions robotics, healthcare, climate models, and government funding.

Fox News article on 2025's tech moments: December 31, 12:52 GMT. IST 18:22. Summary includes OpenAI's Sora and AI race.

Forbes' events playbook: December 30, 21:41 GMT. IST 02:11 next day. Summary about global AI events in 2026.

CNBC article on AI stocks: December 30, 19:41 GMT. IST 00:11 Jan 1. Summary about Meta's acquisition of Manus and top AI stocks.

Insurance Journal article on Zurich's AI tool: December 31, 12:09 GMT. IST 17:39. Summary about the AI-powered tool for multinational contracts.

Business Insider article on VC's predictions: December 31, 10:00 GMT. IST 15:30. Summary mentions robotics and white-collar protests over AI.

Meta's acquisition of Manus (multiple articles): The dates vary between Dec 30 and 31. Need to check each. The Meta articles have different URLs but similar content. Need to consolidate them to avoid duplicates. The main points are Meta buying Manus for AI integration, valued at over $2B.

Substack podcast on 2026 AI predictions: December 31, 04:36 GMT. IST 10:05. Summary about Apple's AI strategy and device predictions.

AP News article on Meta's acquisition: Same as the others, so consolidate.

Now, compiling all these into markdown format, sorting by date (latest first). Need to check for duplicate entries. For example, multiple articles about Meta acquiring Manus. Should I list them as separate entries or combine? Since the user provided separate URLs, maybe include each with their own summary, but the user might prefer consolidation. However, the user's example in the system message shows separate entries for each article. So proceed as separate items even if similar.

Check dates again to sort correctly. The latest date is December 31, 2025, with multiple articles on that day. Then December 30. Sort by IST date, latest first.

Now, formatting each entry with the ### [Date] header (YYYY-MM-DD IST), summary, and URL. Make sure each item is a bullet point under the date. Also, ensure that the URL is correctly linked.
